# sampleRate: Specify a value from 0.0 through 1.0, where 0.0 means no packets are logged 
# and 1.0 means 100% of packets are logged. This field is only relevant if enable is set 
# to true. sampleRate is an optional field, but if it's configured then enable: true must 
# also be set or else it is interpreted as enable: false.
